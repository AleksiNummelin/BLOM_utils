# BLOM_utils

This repo includes tools for NorESM/BLOM analysis. For the moment mainly a python file and a shell script for netcdf3 to netcdf4 compression. For the python script to work I suggest creating a conda environment to which you need to install xarray and netcdf4-python, both can be installed with conda, and then joblib (needs to be installed with pip).
